[{"dateTime":"2022-11-04T14:46:13.789Z","text":"Cross-Reference Code-level performance optimizations are discussed in Chapter 25 and Chapter 26. The more common worry is at the coding level. The concern is that accessing data items indirectly incurs run-time performance penalties for additional levels of object instantiations, routine calls, and so on. This concern is premature. Until you can measure the system's performance and pinpoint the bottlenecks, the best way to prepare for code-level performance work is to create a highly modular design. When you detect hot spots later, you can optimize individual classes and routines without affecting the rest of the system.","hash":"7b5c0f7ef68eafbb296581b33eb6d262","fileHash":"c3d57eb88086a04b1e04d06a9b6188e5","chapterSeperator":"^Chapter \\d\\.","ID":73,"language":"en"},{"hash":"[{\"dateTime\":\"2022-11-04T11:18:42.753Z\",\"text\":\"A good general rule is that a system-level diagram like Figure 5-5 should be an acyclic graph.
