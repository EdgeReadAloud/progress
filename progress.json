What if you want to use nonsequential IDs to improve security? What if you want to be able to reuse the IDs of objects that have been destroyed? What if you want to add an assertion that fires when you allocate more IDs than the maximum number you've anticipated? If you allocated IDs by spreading id = ++g_maxId statements throughout your program, you would have to change code associated with every one of those statements. And, if your program is multithreaded, this approach won't be thread-safe.","hash":"655129b8c156a10a5b91aaba612182d6","fileHash":"c3d57eb88086a04b1e04d06a9b6188e5","chapterSeperator":"^Chapter \\d\\.","ID":73,"language":"en"},{"hash":"[{\"dateTime\":\"2022-11-04T11:18:42.753Z\",\"text\":\"A good general rule is that a system-level diagram like Figure 5-5 should be an acyclic graph.
