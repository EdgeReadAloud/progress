The benefit of inheritance is that it works synergistically with the notion of abstraction. Abstraction deals with objects at different levels of detail. Recall the door that was a collection of certain kinds of molecules at one level, a collection of wood fibers at the next, and something that keeps burglars out of your house at the next level. Wood has certain properties—for example, you can cut it with a saw or glue it with wood glue—and two-by-fours or cedar shingles have the general properties of wood as well as some specific properties of their own.","hash":"32d7e7132c98786447e1f8caccec725b","fileHash":"c3d57eb88086a04b1e04d06a9b6188e5","chapterSeperator":"^Chapter \\d\\.","ID":73,"language":"en"},{"hash":"[{\"dateTime\":\"2022-11-04T11:18:42.753Z\",\"text\":\"A good general rule is that a system-level diagram like Figure 5-5 should be an acyclic graph.
