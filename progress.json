A key concept in object-oriented design is the differentiation between objects and classes. An object is any specific entity that exists in your program at run time. A class is the static thing you look at in the program listing. An object is the dynamic thing with specific values and attributes you see when you run the program. For example, you could declare a class Person that had attributes of name, age, gender, and so on. At run time you would have the objects nancy, hank, diane, tony, and so onâ€”that is, specific instances of the class. If you're familiar with database terms, it's the same as the distinction between \"schema\" and \"instance.\" You could think of the class as the cookie cutter and the object as the cookie. This book uses the terms informally and generally refers to classes and objects more or less inter-changeably.","hash":"4f5b808446d52ee5697f8d97dc2b8467","fileHash":"c3d57eb88086a04b1e04d06a9b6188e5","chapterSeperator":"^Chapter \\d\\.","ID":73,"language":"en"},{"hash":"[{\"dateTime\":\"2022-11-04T11:18:42.753Z\",\"text\":\"A good general rule is that a system-level diagram like Figure 5-5 should be an acyclic graph.
