[{"dateTime":"2022-11-04T14:32:50.790Z","text":"Inheritâ€”When Inheritance Simplifies the Design In designing a software system, you'll often find objects that are much like other objects, except for a few differences. In an accounting system, for instance, you might have both full-time and part-time employees. Most of the data associated with both kinds of employees is the same, but some is different. In object-oriented programming, you can define a general type of employee and then define full-time employees as general employees, except for a few differences, and part-time employees also as general employees, except for a few differences. When an operation on an employee doesn't depend on the type of employee, the operation is handled as if the employee were just a general employee. When the operation depends on whether the employee is full-time or part-time, the operation is handled differently.","hash":"da6230f9302eae7ccd71becb657cc7bc","fileHash":"c3d57eb88086a04b1e04d06a9b6188e5","chapterSeperator":"^Chapter \\d\\.","ID":73,"language":"en"},{"hash":"[{\"dateTime\":\"2022-11-04T11:18:42.753Z\",\"text\":\"A good general rule is that a system-level diagram like Figure 5-5 should be an acyclic graph.
